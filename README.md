This notebook contains sample codes to build and train a gradient boosted tree-based model for rock facies classification using geophysical well log data. Our work shows that the inclusion of physics-motivated feature augmentation can further improve the capability of machine learning in rock facies classification. We demonstrate this approach with the SEG 2016 machine learning contest dataset and the top winner's solution. The improvement is roboust and is ~5% better than current existing best F-1 score.
